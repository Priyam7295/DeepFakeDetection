# Level 1 -> DeepFake Detection 
## Using Neural Network
Fake Image Buster : Detecting Deception with Machine Learning
Welcome to Fake Image Buster , a project dedicated to combating the growing threat of synthetic media.
In today's digital age , the images can easily be manipulated using many GANS or Diffusion models, while these can be useful in many ways but there is a huge concern for safety and this fake images can be misued in many ways .
This project leverages the power of simple Machine Learning to build a **binary classification** model that can distinguish between real and fake images with impressive accuracy.

## Project Highlights:

1. ***Model***:   Using a pre-trained ResNet architecture and adding custom layers for image classification task. We took GAN images and passed it over resnet pre trained model with some more layer layered on top of it , and then we tested our model on different **DIFFUSION MODEL** as well.
1. ***Data Augmentation***:   Enhances training data diversity by applying random rotations ,  
     horizontal rotations that improves generalizability.
1. ***Performance***:   Delivers good accuracy , providing a reliable tool for image verification.
1. ***Testing on DM***:  Testing on different diffusion models .


   





We have used GAN images for training our model and then the test accuracy we are getting is around 80-85 percent for GAN images. 
We further tested our modle on diffusion dataset to see whether our model is somehow generalising on diffusin datasets.
However our model nearly give chance probabilty (50 percent ) while testing for DM images because CNN focuses on Low level cues left by GAN as it is easier to learn and so label all GAN fake images as fake and rest ( DM images , real images ) all as real image. 

## We will further use KNN based classification for creating model than can be used for detecting images generated from any type of GANS and DM images. 

## We are getting around 80 percent accuracy on new GAN Images (Which can be increased by using more diverse datasets)

***This can be increased by taking more variety of images and of different GAN and diffusion family***
**CONCLUSION** - CNN based binary classification on real vs fake image classification works well if trained and performed on GAN images , as it is easier for CNN to learn low level cues then to learn the ways in which an image can be classified as real .

***CNN based Classification can not be generalised for unknown GAN family and Diffusion Based deepfake Model***



# Level ->2 GANS vs DM Image Binary Classification

## using Neural Network for classifying whether the fake image is generated by DM Models or GAN Models.
The need for classifying whether an image is generated by a DM or GAN depends on the goals and objectives of your project. It can have applications in security, transparency, model robustness, content moderation, and various other fields.

## Project Highlights:
    1. We have firstly Trained the model with different DM and GAN images.
    2. **Augmentation** - Data Enhances training data diversity by applying random 
 rotations ,  
      horizontal rotations that improves generalizability.
    3. Now , finally we have tested our model on unseen GAN and DM images getting on a 
 satisfactory average accurcacy of (85-87 %).
