Fake Image Buster : Detecting Deception with Machine Learning
Welcome to Fake Image Buster , a project dedicated to combating the growing threat of synthetic media.
In today's digital age , the images can easily be manipulated using many GANS or Diffusion models, while these can be useful in many ways but there is a huge concern for safety and this fake images can be misued in many ways .
This project leverages the power of simple Machine Learning to build a binary classification model that can distinguish between real and fake images with impressive accuracy.

Project Highlights:
   . Model : Using a pre-trained ResNet architecture ans CNN .
   . Data Augmentation : Enhances training data diversity by applying random rotations ,  
     horizontal rotations that improves generalizability.
   . Performance : Delivers good accuracy .
